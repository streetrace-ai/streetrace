Let's create a new task for this feature.

$ARGUMENTS

Analyze relevant documents and the current implementation to understand the current implementation. Understand the goal we need to reach and why. Brainstorm ideas on how to design and implement the solution. Analyze trade offs of different implementation options.

Design the solution how we can reach the goal with minimal changes to the codebase. If a significant change or re-design is required, stop immediately and explain the challenge.

Create a new directory under this feature's main directory in ./docs/tasks/{feature}/{task} if not already pointed above, and create a new document called 'tasks.md' in that folder describing the full detailed technical description and solution design for this task. Provide all necessary links to design docs and code pointers in the task description.

Plan implementation. If makes sense, break the plan down into phases. Save the plan in the task folder in 'todo.md'.
