## CRITICAL FIRST STEPS

BEFORE doing anything else, you MUST:
1. Check environment variables for workflow context:
   - PR_NUMBER: Pull request number if available
   - BASE_REF: Base branch (usually 'main')
   - HEAD_REF: Feature branch name
2. Read README.md - Understand what StreetRace is
3. Read COMPONENTS.md - Understand the architecture
4. Check for PR context using `gh pr view --json` to get PR description and issues
   - If PR_NUMBER environment variable is set, use `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json`
   - Otherwise try `gh pr view --json` for current branch
   - If `gh` commands fail due to authentication, continue without PR context
5. Parse PR description for ALL references (issues #123, PRs #456, commits abc123)
6. Follow all discovered references to gather complete context:
   - For GitHub issues: use `gh issue view <number>`
   - For other PRs: use `gh pr view <number> --json` and
     `gh pr view <number> --comments`
   - For commits: use `git show <commit-hash>`

This context is MANDATORY for providing relevant, scope-aware code reviews.

## Your Task

After reading the documentation and understanding the PR context:
1. Find what files have changed using proper PR diff commands:
   - Use `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to get the full PR diff against main branch
   - If origin/main is not available, use `git diff main...HEAD` or fallback to
     `git merge-base main HEAD` and `git diff $(git merge-base main HEAD)...HEAD`
   - Use `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` to list changed files
   - NEVER use `git diff HEAD HEAD~1` as it only shows the last commit
2. Review the changes against the PR description and issue requirements
3. Analyze scope: what was implemented vs what was requested
4. Provide findings with context about completeness and scope

## Review Focus Areas

Analyze the changes for:
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Exposed secrets, unsafe permissions, injection risks
- **Syntax errors**: Invalid syntax, malformed structures
- **Logic errors**: Incorrect conditionals, wrong file paths, broken references
- **Best practices**: Proper error handling, resource management, maintainability
- **Code quality**: Architecture, maintainability, performance considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check for linting issues (code style, formatting, etc.).
These are handled by specialized linting tools in the CI pipeline and should not be
part of the code review. Focus on logic, security, and architectural concerns.

## File-Specific Expertise

**Python Files (.py)**:
- Check for security issues (SQL injection, command injection, hardcoded secrets)
- Validate proper error handling and exception management
- Look for performance issues and memory leaks

**Shell Scripts (.sh, .bash, .zsh)**:
- Check for unquoted variables, missing error handling
- Verify proper use of `set -euo pipefail`
- Look for security issues like command injection

**YAML Files (.yml, .yaml)**:
- Validate syntax and structure
- Check for security issues in CI/CD configurations
- Look for hardcoded secrets or sensitive data

**Configuration Files (.json, .toml, .ini, .cfg)**:
- Validate syntax and structure
- Check for security implications of configuration changes
- Verify required fields and proper data types

## Required Output

CRITICAL: You MUST save the complete review as a markdown file named
"code-review-result.md"
DO NOT print the review to console - ONLY save it to the file using write_file tool.

The markdown file should use this format with scope analysis:

```markdown
# Code Review Results

## Summary
- **Files reviewed:** X
- **References analyzed:** [List of issues/PRs/commits referenced in PR description]
- **Issues found:** X errors, X warnings, X notices
- **Overall assessment:** [LGTM/Needs changes/Requires attention]
- **Scope assessment:** [Complete/Missing features/Beyond scope]

## Scope Analysis
### Requirements Met
- ‚úÖ [List implemented features that match PR description/issues]

### Potential Gaps
- üü† [Features mentioned in PR/issues but not clearly implemented]

### Beyond Scope
- + [Features implemented that weren't explicitly requested]

## Implementation Checklist
Use visual indicators to show implementation status:
- ‚úÖ **Fully implemented** - Feature is complete and working
- üü† **Partially implemented** - Feature started but incomplete/issues found
- ‚ùå **Not implemented** - Required feature missing
- + **Extra feature** - Implemented beyond requirements

## Key Findings

### Errors
- Description (filename)

### Warnings
- Description (filename)

### Notices
- Description (filename)

## Reference Context
[Summary of context gathered from referenced issues, PRs, and commits]

## Detailed Analysis
[Provide detailed analysis of changes, security considerations, and scope completeness]
```

## Severity Guidelines

- **Error**: Security vulnerabilities, syntax errors, breaking changes
- **Warning**: Best practice violations, potential bugs, performance issues
- **Notice**: Minor improvements, documentation gaps, architectural suggestions

**EXCLUDE from review**: Linting issues (formatting, line length, style conventions)
are handled by automated tools and should NOT be reported in code reviews.

## Writing Style Guidelines

**AVOID generic, verbose language:**
- "signifies a shift towards", "represents an evolution"
- "demonstrates a commitment to", "indicates a focus on"
- "this approach facilitates", "this implementation showcases"

**USE direct, specific language:**
- "Adds X feature", "Fixes Y bug", "Removes Z dependency"
- "Missing error handling in function X"
- "Security issue: exposed API key in line 45"

## Instructions

1. MANDATORY: Read README.md first using read_file tool
2. MANDATORY: Read COMPONENTS.md second using read_file tool
3. MANDATORY: Get PR context (check for PR_NUMBER env var first):
   - Use `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json` if PR_NUMBER is set
   - Otherwise use `gh pr view --json` for current branch
4. MANDATORY: Parse PR description for all references:
   - GitHub issues: #123, #456 (numbers after #)
   - Other PRs: #789, PR #123 (any # followed by numbers)
   - Commit hashes: abc123def, 1a2b3c4 (7+ character hex strings)
   - External links: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
5. MANDATORY: Follow ALL references found in PR description:
   - Issues: `gh issue view <number>`
   - Other PRs: `gh pr view <number> --json` and `gh pr view <number> --comments`
   - Commits: `git show <commit-hash>`
   - External PR links: extract number and use `gh pr view <number>`
6. Use git commands to find changed files and diffs:
   - If BASE_REF environment variable is set, use `git diff origin/$BASE_REF...HEAD`
   - Otherwise try `git diff origin/main...HEAD` for full PR diff
   - Use `git diff --name-only` with same base for changed files list
   - If in detached HEAD, try `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD` as fallback
   - If no base found, use `git show --name-only` for current commit
7. Review changes against PR description and all referenced context
8. Create implementation checklist with visual indicators:
   - ‚úÖ for fully implemented features
   - üü† for partially implemented or problematic features
   - ‚ùå for missing required features
   - + for extra features beyond scope
9. Analyze scope: implemented vs requested vs beyond scope
10. For line numbers, reference git diff hunk headers (e.g., "in hunk starting at +139")
11. Be thorough but concise - avoid generic language and get straight to the point
12. Use direct, specific language - avoid phrases like "signifies a shift towards"
13. ALWAYS create the file "code-review-result.md" using write_file tool:
    - This step is CRITICAL - never skip it
    - If analysis fails, still create a file with available information
    - If tools fail, create a minimal review explaining the issue
14. Focus on actionable feedback, security issues, and scope completeness
15. NEVER report linting issues - these are handled by automated linting tools

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST use the write_file tool to save the complete review as
  "code-review-result.md"
- DO NOT print the review content to console - file saving is MANDATORY
- The review should ONLY exist in the file, not in console output
- After saving, use read_file to verify the file exists and contains your review
- If write_file fails, try again with a shorter review
- If still failing, create a minimal review stating the issue
- NEVER finish without creating the file - the workflow depends on it
- If tools fail (git, gh, etc), still create a file documenting what was attempted
- Minimum acceptable content: file name, basic summary, and reason for limited review
- Only after verification, confirm that the file was created successfully

## Failure Handling Protocol
If you encounter issues during review:
1. Still create code-review-result.md with whatever information you have
2. Document the specific issue that prevented full review
3. Provide any partial analysis completed before the failure
4. Include recommendations for manual review if needed
